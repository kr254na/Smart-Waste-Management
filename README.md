# ðŸŒ± Smart Waste Management System

An *IoT + Web* solution that automates dustbin monitoring and smart waste collection.  
This system uses ultrasonic sensors and a web dashboard to monitor bin fill-levels, auto-open lids, and visualize data trends.

## 1. Project Overview

A combination of IOT and web application that serves three purposes:

a) Using ultrasonic sensors the dustbin opens on its own as soon as it detects anny human within its range

b) The filled percentage is sent to the web application

c) Comparison chart of last 7 days data for each dustbin

#### Potential users:

a) Parks and zoos

b) Universities

c) Hospitals

Future Scope : 

a) Addition of moisture sensors to distinguish between dry and wet waste

b) Addition of force sensor/ tilt sensor/ accelerometer to avoid sending incorrect data

## 2. Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Auto Lid Opening | Bin lid opens automatically when a human is detected nearby |
| Fill Level Reporting | Sensor sends percent filled to backend |
| Dashboard Visualization | View current and historical data for each bin |
| Multi-Bin Support | Supports multiple bins tracked independently |
| REST API | Server APIs for data ingestion, retrieval, and view rendering |
| Real-Time Updates | Live data reflected on the dashboard |

---

## 3. Architecture & Workflow

Hereâ€™s a high-level flow:

1. Ultrasonic sensors installed in each dustbin measure distance of waste level.
2. When a person comes near, a trigger opens the lid.
3. The sensorâ€™s measured fill-level (percentage) is sent to the backend via HTTP (or MQTT, if extended).
4. Backend stores and processes data (e.g. last 7 days).
5. Frontend (web dashboard) fetches current and historical fill-levels and shows charts and comparisons.

## 6. API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                       |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/bins      | Fetch status of all smart bins    |
| GET    | /api/bins/:id  | Fetch details of a specific bin   |
| POST   | /api/bins      | Add new bin data (IoT device input) |
| PUT    | /api/bins/:id  | Update bin information            |
| DELETE | /api/bins/:id  | Remove a bin record               |

**Example Request:**

  ```bash
  POST /api/bins
  {
    "location": "Block A",
    "fillLevel": 60,
    "lidStatus": "open"
  }
  ```
